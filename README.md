# Classification-Pipeline-with-scikit-learn
Building a classification pipeline in Python using scikit-learn. This notebook serves as a reusable template for tackling classification problems.
The workflow covers key steps such as:
* Data preprocessing and Feature engineering.
* Adressing data leakage problem.
* Handling imbalanced data in classification.
* Building a reusable pipline to to train several models.
* Optimization techniques such as grid search, crossvalidation, precision-recall trade-off, feature importance..etc.
